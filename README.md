In this project, a frontend website is designed with the help of HTML, CSS and JS. It allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
During model building almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc are covered. Technology and tools used are,

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, pycharm as IDE
6. Python flask for http server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI


To run the app, install all the requirements.
Then open command prompt, change the directory location to cd  C:\Users\your code location\Server and run 'python server.py'
